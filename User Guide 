   Install the necessary Python libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up the Database:**

   If using PostgreSQL, configure your database settings in `config.py` and create the necessary tables:

   ```python
   # config.py
   DATABASE_URI = 'postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/pii_db'
   ```

   Run the setup script:

   ```bash
   python setup_db.py
   ```

5. **Build and Run Docker Container:**

   To containerize Pii:

   ```bash
   docker build -t pii-app .
   docker run -p 5000:5000 pii-app
   ```

6. **Deploy to the Cloud:**

   For cloud deployment, push your Docker image to a registry (e.g., Docker Hub) and deploy using a service like AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

---

## **4. Getting Started**

### **Initial Configuration**

Once Pii is installed, you need to configure the environment and initialize any necessary databases. This setup involves:

1. **Configuring API Endpoints:**

   Define the base URL and API key for accessing external services or integrating with other platforms.

2. **Setting Up the Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in your project root with environment-specific settings like database credentials, API keys, and secret keys.

3. **Running Initial Scripts:**

   If required, run initialization scripts to populate the database with any default data or to prepare the environment for first-time use.

### **Running the Application**

To start Pii, simply run the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

Alternatively, if you are using Docker, start your container:

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 pii-app
```

Access the application through your browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

   - Fine-tune the existing models on domain-specific legal datasets.
   - Use frameworks like Hugging Face Transformers to implement model updates.

2. **Adding Custom Pipelines:**
   - Create custom NLP pipelines for specialized tasks such as named entity recognition (NER) or contract analysis.
   - Integrate these pipelines into the existing Pii framework.

### **Database Integration**

Pii uses PostgreSQL for persistent storage of legal documents and related metadata:

1. **Advanced Querying:**
   - Utilize SQL queries for complex searches and data retrieval.
   - Implement indexing and optimization techniques to enhance performance.
